# Abhijith Anil Vamadev: Data Scientist

## About Me
This portfolio showcases my skills that I have gained through my Masters in Applied Data Science at Syracuse University. Throughout my academic journey, I have been able to acquire various data science techniques and tools. I have been able to apply these techniques and tools in various industry projects both at the university and at internships. I have gained valuable knowledge in working with databases, developed the ability to create actional insights using data through the use of programming languages such as Python and R. This portfolio includes projects that which I have tackled real-world problems by applying different data science techniques such as data preparation, feature engineering, data aggregation, model creation and selection and deployment of projects to the cloud to monitor and assess the model performance. The projects covers different domains in real-estate, finance and healthcare that showcases my ability to apply data science knowledge in different domains.
